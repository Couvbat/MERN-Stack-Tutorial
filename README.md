To implement CSRF protection using express-session and csrf-tokens in an Express.js application, follow these steps:

Install Required Packages: Ensure you have express, express-session, and csrf installed. If not, install them using npm or yarn.

Setup Express Session: Configure express-session middleware to manage sessions.

Integrate CSRF Middleware: Use the csrf package to create a middleware that generates and validates CSRF tokens.

Send CSRF Token to Client: Include the CSRF token in your forms or as a meta tag in your HTML head for AJAX requests.

Validate CSRF Token on Incoming Requests: Ensure that every state-changing request (POST, PUT, DELETE) includes the CSRF token for validation.

Here's a step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Install Required Packages
Step 2: Setup Express and Express-Session
Step 3: Integrate CSRF Middleware
Step 4: Send CSRF Token to Client
In your form or AJAX setup, include the CSRF token:

For AJAX, include the token in your request headers or body.

Step 5: Validate CSRF Token on Incoming Requests
The middleware setup in Step 3 automatically validates the CSRF token for every POST, PUT, or DELETE request.

This setup ensures that your application is protected against CSRF attacks by leveraging express-session and csrf-tokens.
